# convert_pmod_to_blood

pmod is a popular software for kineatic modeling requiring blood data to be imported in a specific manner (see https://doc.pmod.com/pkin/importofblooddata6839.html). Here, we convert those files to create _blood.tsv files according to BIDS. By default (although this can be turned off), the accompagning json file is also created (but requires more user input).
